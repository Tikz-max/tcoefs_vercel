<p><strong>TCoEFS PARTICIPATES IN CAMEROON STUDY VISIT ON SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS</strong></p><p><em>Strengthening Nigeria’s agroforestry and curriculum development through GP AgSys</em></p><p>Dateline: Yaoundé, Cameroon — June 5–13, 2025<br />Byline: TCoEFS Communications Unit (University of Jos)</p><p>The TETFund Centre of Excellence in Food Security (TCoEFS) at the University of Jos participated in a high-level study visit to Cameroon under the Global Programme on Sustainable Agricultural Systems and Policies (GP AgSys).</p><p>The programme, implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH) and commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), seeks to promote sustainable agricultural practices and support institutional reforms that make food systems more resilient.</p><p>Representing the Centre was Prof. Dauda Bitrus Bawa, Director of TCoEFS, who joined fellow Nigerian academics and policymakers for an intensive week of workshops, field demonstrations, and peer-to-peer learning.</p><p><strong>Why this visit matters</strong></p><p>Nigeria is accelerating efforts to embed sustainable agriculture, agroforestry and climate-smart practices into training and extension. The Cameroon mission offered peer learning with institutions that have successfully integrated agroforestry into curricula and field programs, providing practical models TCoEFS and partners can adapt at home.</p><p>“This mission reinforced how agroforestry can boost productivity, restore soils, and strengthen resilience,” said Prof. Dauda Bitrus Bawa, Director, TCoEFS. “We are translating these insights into classroom curricula, field demonstrations, and policy engagement so farmers feel the benefits quickly.”</p><p><strong>Objectives of the mission</strong></p><ul><li>Exchange curriculum integration strategies for agroforestry and GAP.</li><li>Observe field-level demonstrations and farmer engagement models.</li><li>Identify institutional partnerships for staff training and joint research.</li><li>Inform Nigeria’s National Agroforestry Training Manual and the Green Colleges roll-out.</li></ul><p><strong>Key activities and learning highlights</strong></p><ul><li>Workshops in Yaoundé: Sessions with Cameroonian counterparts and GIZ technical teams on curriculum design, assessment, and competency-based training.</li><li>Field demonstrations: Visits to agroforestry plots and model farms showcasing tree–crop integration, soil cover, water management, and post-harvest handling.</li><li>Extension models: Practical examples of farmer field schools and co-created learning that place farmers at the centre of innovation.</li><li>Institutional alignment: How ministries, training colleges, and development partners coordinate curriculum, field practice, and policy.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’ll apply in Nigeria</strong></p><ul><li>Embed agroforestry modules with hands-on practicums in partner colleges.</li><li>Set up demonstration plots and farmer field schools linked to curricula.</li><li>Develop assessment rubrics that measure practical competencies.</li><li>Produce teaching aids (lesson plans, visuals, safety &amp; quality checklists).</li></ul><p><strong>TCoEFS next steps</strong></p><ol><li>Curriculum integration (UniJos &amp; partners): Work with the Faculty of Agriculture to weave agroforestry and regenerative practices into existing courses and short certificates.</li><li>Research &amp; demonstration farm: Establish pilot agroforestry blocks for training, data collection, and technology validation.</li><li>Training of Trainers (ToT): Build a cadre of lecturers, extension staff, and graduate fellows to cascade skills nationwide.</li><li>Policy engagement: Contribute evidence and case studies to national manuals, policy briefs, and MAP (multi-actor platform) dialogues.</li><li>Partnerships: Explore MoUs with Cameroonian institutions and expand collaboration under GP AgSys.</li></ol><p><em>“From lab to lecture room to field, our focus is adoption,” Prof. Bawa added. “TCoEFS will keep building the human and institutional capacity Nigeria needs for a food-secure future.”</em></p><p><strong>Appreciation to Organizers and Partners</strong></p><p>TCoEFS extends its sincere appreciation to GIZ Nigeria and GIZ Cameroon for organizing the study visit, and to the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) for funding the programme.</p><p>The Centre also acknowledges the Green Colleges Initiative and all partner institutions whose collaboration made this mission a success.</p><p>Photo highlights (add your images)</p><p><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-1.jpeg" /></p><p><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-2.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-3.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-4.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-5.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-6.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-7.jpeg" /><img src="/news/tcoefs-participates-in-cameroon-study-visit-on-sustainable-agricultural-systems/images/img-8.jpeg" /></p>
