The event was hosted by the Federal Republic of Nigeria’s Senate, and the theme of the session, “Challenges and Opportunities in Agricultural Education,” underscored the need for comprehensive reforms to strengthen agricultural colleges and institutions across the nation.</p><p><img alt=\"A poster on a wall\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" src=\"/news/tetfund-centre-of-excellence-in-food-security-tcoefs-leads-discussion-on-agricul/images/img-1.jpeg\" /></p><p>Chaired by Senator Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli, the session’s primary objective was to engage collaboratively with all stakeholders in the agricultural education sector. Senator Alli outlined the Senate Committee's reform agenda and work plan, which aims to transform agricultural education in Nigeria into a globally competitive, climate-smart, and innovation-driven system.</p><p>The session was not just another meeting, but a pivotal step in addressing the current challenges facing agricultural colleges. Key issues such as outdated curricula, inadequate infrastructure, and limited industry partnerships were discussed. The TCoEFS team, including Professor Dauda Bawa, was actively involved in deliberations on modernizing Nigeria’s agricultural education framework to better align with global best practices.</p><p><img alt=\"A group of people sitting in a room\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" src=\"/news/tetfund-centre-of-excellence-in-food-security-tcoefs-leads-discussion-on-agricul/images/img-2.jpeg\" /></p><p>A major highlight of the session was the announcement that Nigeria will lead a delegation of agricultural educators and stakeholders to the COP30 Climate Conference in Brazil. This global event will provide a platform to showcase Nigeria's agricultural innovations and promote the country’s green colleges as models for climate-resilient food systems. The Senate's involvement in this conference aims to position Nigeria as a leader in climate-smart agricultural practices and foster international partnerships to drive knowledge transfer and investment in sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Promise Amahah, Technical Consultant to the Senate Committee, highlighted the significance of Nigeria’s participation at COP30, saying that the delegation would not only showcase local agricultural innovations but also advocate for the integration of green institutions into the global conversation on sustainable agriculture.</p><p>During the session, the Senate also outlined plans for the First Legislative Summit and Expo on Agricultural Colleges and Institutions, scheduled for October 2025. This initiative will provide a platform for stakeholders to discuss research, innovations, and policy reforms that will reshape Nigeria's agricultural education landscape. Additionally, a Global Benchmarking Tour is planned for early 2026, where Nigerian representatives will visit leading agricultural institutions in Brazil and the European Union to study best practices.</p><p><img alt=\"A person and person standing next to a podium\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" src=\"/news/tetfund-centre-of-excellence-in-food-security-tcoefs-leads-discussion-on-agricul/images/img-3.jpeg\" /></p><p>TCoEFS, in collaboration with development partners like the German development agency GIZ and Sasakawa Africa, stressed the importance of integrating agroforestry modules into agricultural college curricula. GIZ’s representative, Lata Rieger, applauded the Senate’s leadership in driving innovation within Nigeria’s agricultural education system, calling for the institutionalization of agroforestry training across the country.</p><p>Professor Dauda Bawa, speaking on behalf of Sasakawa-GIZ, emphasized that agroforestry integration would help build a more resilient and sustainable food system. He urged that these programs be embedded within Nigeria's national agricultural education framework. Through the collaboration between TCoEFS and Sasakawa-GIZ, crop-specific agroforestry training programs, including those for rice, cassava, and Irish potatoes, are already being developed and incorporated into the curriculum of agricultural institutions across Nigeria.</p><p><img alt=\"A group of people standing in a room\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" src=\"/news/tetfund-centre-of-excellence-in-food-security-tcoefs-leads-discussion-on-agricul/images/img-4.jpeg\" /></p><p>As the session concluded, there was a renewed commitment from all stakeholders to support the shared vision of transforming Nigeria’s agricultural education system into one that is future-ready, climate-resilient, and globally competitive. The Senate’s reform agenda, bolstered by TCoEFS’s advocacy, aims to ensure that Nigeria’s agricultural colleges become incubators of innovation, research, and entrepreneurship, ultimately contributing to the nation’s food security and sustainable development.</p><p><img alt=\"A group of people sitting in a conference room\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" src=\"/news/tetfund-centre-of-excellence-in-food-security-tcoefs-leads-discussion-on-agricul/images/img-5.jpeg\" /></p>",
